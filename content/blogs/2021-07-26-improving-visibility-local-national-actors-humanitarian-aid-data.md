summary: Report exploring technical options for increasing the visibility of local and national actors in International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) data.

The limited visibility of local and national organisations in humanitarian open aid data adds to the challenges of meeting and tracking the Grand Bargain commitment to provide more direct support to local and national actors. In support of the Grand Bargain transparency workstream and with funding from the Netherlandsâ€™ Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Development Initiatives (DI) explored the technical options for increasing the visibility of local and national actors in International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) data. This report highlights the technical methodology we pursued through our prototype tool development, key findings and recommendations for next steps.
