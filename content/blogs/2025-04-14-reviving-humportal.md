summary: The IATI Humanitarian Data Portal has been revived by Emergentally and will now update on a daily basis.

As many colleagues will be aware, Development Initiatives ceased operations in October 2024. The Humportal then stopped updating on 7th January 2025.

The Humportal has now been revived by [Emergentally](https://emergentally.com). In the first instance, we have:

* pointed the data generation scripts at the new [IATI Dashboard](https://dashboard.iatistandard.org/)
* updated links to an archived version of the DI website
* added our contact information to the about page and the footer
* set the Humportal to (once again) automatically update each day

Emergentally intends to maintain the Humportal going forward on behalf of the humanitarian community. We would welcome colleagues to get in touch if you have any questions or requests for improvements: [humportal@emergentally.com](mailto:humportal@emergentally.com)
