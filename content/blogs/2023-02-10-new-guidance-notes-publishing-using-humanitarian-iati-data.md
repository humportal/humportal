The technical leads of the Grand Bargain Transparency workstream have shared draft guidance notes outlining how IATI data can be useful to track commitments under the Grand Bargain, including localisation, earmarking and multi-year funding. Some of the guidance proposed here is a bit different to what has come before. This takes into account the experience of working with humanitarian publishers over the last few years.

You can find the notes in the [Guidance section](/guidance) of the HumPortal.

As part of these notes, we’ve also included some information how the data can be used. There are a few little interactive pieces in there for the localisation and earmarking sections.

On the **[localisation](/guidance/localisation)** note, for example, you can see where a publisher has used organisation identifiers to refer to partners in “developing” countries (according to UN definitions), which are likely to refer in most cases to local and national actors.

On the **[earmarking](/guidance/earmarking)** note, you can see an initial attempt to classify spending according to Grand Bargain earmarking categories, using a mapping table from OECD DAC Aid Types.
