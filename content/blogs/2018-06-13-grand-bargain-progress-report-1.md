The report provides an update on progress made in meeting the Grand Bargain commitments on greater transparency since DIâ€™s [baseline report](https://devinit.github.io/resources/baseline-report-implementing-and-monitoring-the-grand-bargain-commitment-on-transparency/) was published in June 2017, as well as on improvements to the IATI Standard to better meet the needs of humanitarian publishers and data users. It also offers recommendations for further action by the Grand Bargain transparency workstream and the wider humanitarian community.
