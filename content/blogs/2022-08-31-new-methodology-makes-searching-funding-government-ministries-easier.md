summary: A blog outlining a new methodology to improve the identification of partner country government entities in open data.

In the past, it was difficult to search IATI data for activities related to individual government agencies because there was no agreed way to clearly identify them. This created a lot of work for data users, who need to make sense of a large volume of data on unidentified organisations. This methodology enables unique identifiers to be assigned for each ministry within a partner country government. It builds on more than a decade of past experience on integrating development and humanitarian activities with country budget systems and processes.
